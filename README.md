R and Stan files accompanying the manuscript *Estimating (non)linear selection on reaction norms: A general framework for labile traits* (Martin et al., 2024). A detailed starting tutorial for applying the Bayesian mixed effects models proposed in this paper to Gaussian data can be found in the "nls-basic-tutorial.pdf" file. Additional tutorials for more complex scenarios are also currently being prepared. Other files in this repo are available for replication or expansion on the simulation-based calibration and power analyses reported in the paper. Please email at jordan.martin@uzh.ch if you'd like further help applying these methods and/or have any additional questions.
