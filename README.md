R and Stan files accompanying the manuscript *Estimating (non)linear selection on reaction norms: A general framework for labile traits* (Martin et al., 2025). A detailed tutorial for applying the Bayesian mixed effects models proposed in this paper can be found in the "nls-tutorial.pdf" file. Other files in this repo are available for replication of the model validation and performance simulation reported in the paper. Please email at jordanscott.martin@eawag.ch if you'd like further help applying these methods and/or have any additional questions.
