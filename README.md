R and Stan files accompanying the manuscript *Estimating (non)linear selection on reaction norms: A general framework for labile traits* (Martin et al., 2024). A detailed starting tutorial for applying the Bayesian mixed effects models proposed in this paper can be found in the "BRN-selection-tutorial.pdf" file. This tutorial has not yet been modified since the previous 2021 preprint version but will be updated shortly. Additional tutorials for more complex scenarios are also currently being prepared. Files are also available to replicate or otherwise expand on the simulation-based calibration and power analyses reported in the paper. Please email at jordan.martin@uzh.ch if you'd like further help applying these methods and/or have any additional questions.
